        <h2>Above &amp; Beyond</h2>
        <div id="above-beyond">This may have been one of the most difficult projects that I've had to work on during my academic time here at RIT
            <br>but not because of the project itself, but because of the learning. I really had to work on this project, and by work, I mean truly
            <br>learn JavaScript, JQuery, JQueryUI, CSS Grid Layouts, and myriad of other things. This project took quite some time to get through.
            <br>I know that the evidence may be hard to figure out based on the amounts of commits on the GitHub repo towards the end of the due date,
            <br>but that's because most of the time I was sitting trying to understand how to work on the features that I needed to implement for my
            <br>schedule. Learning JavaScript was very different in terms of other languages, because even though JavaScript has similarities to other
            <br>languages, it's so very unique all on its own. Truly. I do not believe I have spent nearly this much time on a project before trying to
            <br>to understand a language and use it. I sat through so many articles, videos, and tutorials to understand how to use it in regards to the
            <br>DOM and interacting with the webpages. Also learning how to use CSS Grid Layouts was a challenge. I searched everywhere to find information
            <br>on how to create a responsive grid layout with ease. This project was probably the most useful ones I worked on, seeing as it has taught
            <br>me a lot about what it means to be a developer and a web programmer.
        </div>

        <h2>What I have learned</h2>
        <div id="learned">Man, what haven't I learned? I've learned JavaScript, JQuery, JQueryUI, and CSS Grid Layout, but not even just that. I learned
            <br>how to search for answers. How to ask for help. How to realize when there are some tasks that have already been done, and implementing
            <br>open source code helps quite a bit. I've learned what it means to make compromises sometimes. Now I'm not saying that all projects need
            <br>to have compromises, but for learning purposes, it's helped a lot. I made some over generalizations for my project. I thought that I could
            <br>do more than I thought, and albeit, if I had more time, I could have gotten more done, but most of my time was dedicated to learning what I
            <br>was working with, and how to apply it to my website. I really wished I could have implemented all features, and I really tried, but there just
            <br>wasn't enough time, and I realize how bad that is on my part. I've learned is that I need to make specific goals, and work on them. As I
            <br>continued through the project, I learned how important that really is, and creating a better guideline for myself would help.
        </div>

        <h2>Changes to Website</h2>
        <div id="changes">The changes that I made for the website were for schedule three mainly, but also to schedule one. Originally, for schedule one, I
            <br>wasn't sure if I was going to allow the user to be able to drag the events around through the actual grid layout, but there were errors occuring
            <br>that I couldn't find a solution to, and even then, the intentions of the fix would go against the original intentions of my schedule. The second
            <br>schedule ended up being almost exactly the same as what I intended. I was really happy with the way it turned out. The third schedule, however, I
            <br>made a few adjustments for. I got rid of the extended boxes for the longer time frames. The reason being for that choice is that increasing the area of
            <br>the screen for just appearence defeats the purpose of good screen usage, and I learned how to use that after this semester, or atleast I hope so. Also,
            <br>the edit function wasn't also giving me some trouble, and so now it just deletes the element and opens up a panel to create an element in its place.
            <br>Overall, the changes to the website weren't super major as they could have been, and they interactivity and the learning process while going through this
            <br>made all the difference.
        </div>
    
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <div id="problems">The css files that I am using based off of spectrum do not validate without errors, so I just wanted to alert you to the errors, and that
            <br>you know that it's not my css that doesn't validate. As well as that, the actual interactiveness of schedule one does not work properly on mobile. A
            <br>mouse is required to drag that events around, and so therefore mobile will not allow dragging unless one has a mouse.
