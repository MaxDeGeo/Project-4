# Project-4
	My approach to this project will be to create an interactive schedule in which the user can create, well, schedules, using assorted schedules that each will each use a different approach and style to create a personal schedule for the user.
	
## Schedule 1
	The first schedule will allow the user to drag and place specific events into a schedule, each type color coded to create an easy to view schedule.
	
## Schedule 2
	The second schedule will allow the user to create custom events for each day of the week, using the same feature as the first schedule, yet, it will remove the dates from the side, and allow the user to input a custom time frame for the block. The user will also be allowed to turn off and on the days of the week depending on what they want to view and add to.
	
## Schedule 3
	The third schedule will continue the same idea as the first and second, except the size of the blocks will be bigger depending on how long they are in terms of time, and that they can be edited and removed once they are created.

	The goal of this project is to understand JavaScript more and how I can use JavaScript and jQuery libraries to help create more professional and interactive websites.
